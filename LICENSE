krystal clear license:

this license has a focus on both freedom and software preservation, but also consider the creator's rights and monetary gain

1# dont charge for this software or the software others make using my own software, respect the original developers

2# your project can only be closed source for max of 5 years, after these 5 years you must release the source code publicly (you can still charge for the compiled version of your software) on the most used version control at the time (currently github) and in case your work do little profit and just suddenly after some years of release it gets the public attention, you can email me on the email on https://crystalsoft.neocities.org so you can renew your closed source time.

3# in case your project depends on any other that has this license (including the ones in this repository) and you want to charge for it, if the creator of the project have any violation on the public knowledge that they were the creator of the dependency and/or significant (at least 10%) monetary loss, they gave the rights to take such project down. this rule is to prevent content theft.

4# if your project is a FOSS (must be both free and open source) one, rights on 2 and 3 do not apply.

5# you MUST ALWAYS give credit to the things your project depends on, using either things like credits on games, or 'about' sections or the description of the software.
